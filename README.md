# Voters-Monitoring-System
This is the code to my PHP project called voters monitoring system. This system has the records of 98 thousand voters from Sto. Tomas, Batangas and is used in 2019 campaign period. This system is used to generate statistics and percentage of the campaign performance. This time I used OOP paradigm in my coding.
